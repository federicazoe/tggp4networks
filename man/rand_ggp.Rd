\usage{
rand_ggp(alpha, sigma, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{positive real number. Affects the number of nodes and edges (higher alpha leads to larger networks).}

\item{sigma}{real number. in (-Inf, 1). sigma < 0 corresponds to a finite-activity GGP (dense case).}

\item{tau}{positive real number. Affects the tails of the degree distribution (higher tau leads to faster decay).}
}
\value{
A real-valued vector with an approximate sample from the GGP.
}
\description{
Samples points of the Generalized Gamma Process (GGP) with LÃ©vy measure
\deqn{[alpha / Gamma(1-sigma)] * w^(-1-sigma)  * exp(-tau * w)}
When sigma < 0, exact sampling is possible.
For sigma >= 0, approximate samples are obtained using the adaptive 
thinning strategy described in Favaro and Teh (2013).

w <- simulate_ggp(20, 0.5, 1)
